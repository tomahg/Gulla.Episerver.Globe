# Gulla.ViewOnWebsite for CMS 11

This is the readme for the CMS 12 version, the version for CMS 11 is [over here](https://github.com/tomahg/Gulla.ViewOnWebsite/).

## The good old days

In Episerver CMS prior to the [UI refresh](https://world.episerver.com/blogs/ryan-bare/dates/2019/6/cms-ui-refresh/) in Episerver.CMS.UI 11.21.0 we were able to open the current content, and see what our visitors would see, by simply clicking the globe on the toolbar.

## The new stuff

In Episerver.CMS.UI 11.21.0 the globe disappeared! We would first have to click «Options» and then «View on website» to accomplish the same. That is one more click I do not want to do.

## Get the globe back

Using this module, you'll get that old familiar globe back on your toolbar! Clicking the globe, will open the current content. Nothing more, nothing less.
